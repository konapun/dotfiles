## My portable environment

<hr>
I regularly jump across Windows, MacOS, and various Linux DEs so this is an attempt to script my environment to be usable wherever I go. In particular,
it provides installation and configuration for:
  * git
  * neovim
  * tmux
  * ranger
  * zsh
  * fonts
  * Windows Terminal (where available)
  * Gnome Terminal (where available)
  * (more coming soon as I get it working for my bspwm setup)

### Theming
My approach to theming is in the form of patching a known setup. Rather than using templates for my initial config, my initial config is based off gruvbox
and then a specific theme is patched over the top on the target machine by replacing known values.

Currently available themes are:
  * Gruvbox
  * (more on the way)
